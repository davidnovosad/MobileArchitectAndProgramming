# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I developed a simple application for users to track their weight.
Some of the requirements include sms messaging permissions when user meets their goal, ability to create a new account and ability to log in with creadentials, ability to add, update, and delete weight for any particular day, and ability to see all of the weight entries on the main page.
This app was designed to address needs of users that are looking for a simple weight tracking app without any of the complicated calorie trackers or excessive data.
Users who are lokking to lose, maintain, or gain weight are the main user base that this app was trying to impress.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There is a total of five screens: login and register screens, main page, and screens to add/ update and remove weight
The application is simplistic to attract users who do not want to spend too much time plugging in their infomration and want to have accurate weight tracked on their app every day.
The app has clear buttons and options so that users know what to do on any of the screens and the app also has prompts to help users to keep their data accurate.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
For our project milestones we first created a proposal document on how the app would look and what features would try to be developed for this app.
For the second milestone we developed all of the layout screens with form fields and buttons to showcase the look of the app.
Lastly, we developed the code in Java to bring the application to life with all of the promised features.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
We tested the app in the emulator on a virtual device. Testing was going through all of the cases what users could possibly click to ensure nothing causes fatal error or a crash of the application.
Thanks to this approach we discovered bugs and were able to work them out so that the app works 100% without issues and errors.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The proposal and ui design were the easier parts and took relatively short time. The main challenge started when the actual logic and code had to be developed. 
Initially, I had a lot od issues and errors which prevented me from pushing forward. I could not start the app or none of the screens would connect to other layouts as I wanted it to. 
At one point I wanted to give up, but decided to fight as hard as I can to make it work.
After excesive research on what is causing these issues, I was finally able to make a breakthrough and finish the app on time.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was very happy with creating the databsase, once I understood how it works. For my knowledge and skill to improve, I had to download SQLite databse reader to further improve my understanding of the code and 
issues that I was doing. At the beginning, the whole time I tought the databse was created wrong and that is causing the issue, but after looking at it in the database reader I saw that it is actually created perfetly and 
my functions were developed wrong. This helped me make necessary updates and I started making big progress.
